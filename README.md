# Student Portfolio (Cayman theme)

**Zero-install, Markdown-only.** Students edit `.md` files in the browser.  
GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.

## Publish
1) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `/ (root)` → Save.  
2) Site appears at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Where to edit
- `about.md` → resume-style About page (contact, education, skills, experience).  
- `assignments/assignment-1.md` … `assignment-5.md` → weekly submissions.  
- `assignments/index.md` → auto-links to all assignments.  
- `final-project.md` → placeholder for now.  
- `notes/` → any personal notes (`notes/index.md` has a template).

> Students shouldn’t need to touch `_config.yml`.
